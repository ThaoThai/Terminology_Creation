# Terminology_Creation

We want a Web User Interface that provides a place for user to translate technical terminologies from one language to another. In addition, the fluent-speaker user will be able to provide his/her translation of the terms or the back-translate (or literal translation) of the terms from one language to another.

There are three components to the project: algorithm, database and Web user interface: 

  -The database will contain 1000+ technical terminologies and 200+ languages.
  
  -The algorithm that extract existing terms from the open source software translations using statistical methods and populate the database with the existing terms through the extraction process.
  
  -The Web User Interface will provide a text insertion from user, conversion between language, and addition of translation/back-translation. User should be able to sign up and log in to do any editing.
